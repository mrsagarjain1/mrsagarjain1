# Hi there Sagar Here 👋  

I'm a builder and a problem-solver who loves where AI meets automation. Right now, I'm deep in the world of **LangChain**, figuring out how to make LLMs do cool, practical things by connecting them to APIs and data.

I've also spent the last 4+ years crafting **OpenWRT firmware** and networking solutions—think Embedded Linux, VPNs, and making networks smarter and faster.

**When I'm not staring at a terminal:**
- 💪 Pushing weights at the gym.
- 🏍️ Cruising on my motorcycle.
- 🎮 Getting competitive in FPS games.
- ♟️ Outsmarting friends in chess.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, drop me a line! I'm always down to chat about tech, potential projects, or the best FPS strategies.
